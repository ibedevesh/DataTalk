I faced unexpected delays, unclear instructions, and a lack of proper updates, which made the entire process frustrating. Instead of simplifying things, it ended up wasting my time.

We applied for a Singapore visa for four through Atlys. After two weeks of silence and generic replies, we contacted the Singapore Consulate—who confirmed Atlys never submitted our application and is not an Authorized Visa Agent (AVA). When confronted, Atlys claimed rejection but later agreed to cancel and refund under pressure.

After raising the ticket with the customer service, I have received 4 calls from the team without any proper update. I have attached the screen shot confirmations of the emails and the app stating the payment has been deducted twice and the customer service comes back asking for bank statements along with the account number for God knows what reasons.

I applied for a UAE visa with these scammers amd they charged some 6k. Nex day I got an email that I already have a visa valid for UAE and that's why they can't proceed with my application. They especially have a non refundable clause in their terms. I applied my visa with another local agent and he did the job. Scammers like atlys must be thrown out of the store and public reach.2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo"
